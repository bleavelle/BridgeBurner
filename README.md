# Bridge Burner

A fast, keyboard-driven photo culling and organization tool. Built for photographers who shoot RAW+JPEG and need to quickly review, cull, and organize thousands of photos.

**Note: This README was generated by AI (Claude) and may be incomplete or awkwardly worded. Contributions welcome!**

## Features

- **Fast Lightbox View** - Navigate photos with arrow keys, cull with X, keep with K
- **RAW+JPEG Pairing** - Automatically pairs RAW files with their JPEG previews
- **Date-Based Import** - Preview photos by date and select which dates to import
- **GoPro Conversion** - Auto-detects GoPro files and converts to editing-friendly formats (DNxHD, ProRes, etc.)
- **Open in GIMP** - Press G to open RAW files in GIMP (converts to TIFF via darktable)
- **Project Organization** - Organizes files into RAW/JPEG/Video/Other folders
- **Project Notes** - Add notes to projects for future reference

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- FFmpeg (for video conversion)
- GIMP 3 (optional, for "Open in GIMP" feature)
- darktable (optional, for RAW to TIFF conversion)

## Contributing

This project was built quickly and there's lots of room for improvement. If you're handy with code and want to help out, here's what still needs work:

### TODO List

**Cross-Platform Support**
- [ ] Linux support for GIMP/darktable paths (currently hardcoded to Windows)
- [ ] macOS support and testing
- [ ] Linux folder picker (zenity/kdialog is partially implemented but untested)

**Features**
- [ ] Batch export selected photos
- [ ] Star ratings (1-5) in addition to keep/cull
- [ ] Color labels
- [ ] Search/filter by filename, date, rating
- [ ] Slideshow mode
- [ ] Compare mode (view 2 photos side by side)
- [ ] Histogram display
- [ ] EXIF metadata panel
- [ ] Zoom/pan in lightbox
- [ ] Undo/redo for cull actions

**Technical Improvements**
- [ ] Better error handling throughout
- [ ] Loading indicators for slow operations
- [ ] Thumbnail caching for faster browsing
- [ ] WebSocket for real-time progress updates (instead of polling)
- [ ] Database backend option (currently uses JSON files)
- [ ] More unit tests
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline

**UI/UX**
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Touch/mobile support
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Drag and drop import

**Video**
- [ ] Video playback in lightbox
- [ ] Video trimming
- [ ] Batch video conversion outside of import

The name "Bridge Burner" is a reference to Adobe Bridge, which this tool aims to replace for basic culling workflows. We're burning that bridge. Get it? ...I'll see myself out.
